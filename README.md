    path: the path to the folder containing all image files

The the path is relative to this main.py file.
*Note: The folder must only contain image files, even hidden files will cause a crash.*

`python main.py "path" -sh`

`python main.py "path" -sa "path-to-save"`

The image will output as "answer.png in the path to save the image".
